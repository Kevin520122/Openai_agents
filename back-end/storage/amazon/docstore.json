The eventsand consequences discussed in thes\ne risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a materialadverse effect on our busin\ness, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows,liquidity, and stock price. Th\nese risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that arenot presently known to us or that we cur\nrently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition, the global economic climate amplifiesmany of these risks.\nWe Face Intense Competition\nOur businesses are rapidly evolv\ning and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, andin different industries, i\nncluding physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronicdevices, digital conten\nt, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longerhistories, more custome\nrs, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. Theymay secure better t\nerms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.Competition continues to int\nensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as ourcompetitors enter in\nto business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. Inaddition, new and enhanced techno\nlogies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increaseour competition. The Inte\nrnet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses tocompete against us. As a resul\nt of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may berequired to increase ou\nr spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\nWe are continuing to rap\nidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling ourinfrastructure to suppor\nt our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management,personnel, operations, systems, \ntechnical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases thesefactors. Failure to man\nage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks\nWe may have limited o\nr no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings,which can present new and diffi\ncult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures orother quality issues. In addi\ntion, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these neweractivities to recoup ou\nr investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the valueof those investments being wri\ntten down or written off.We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\nWe are not always able to \naccurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion ofour expenses and investments is \nfixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.Our revenue growth may not be sustain\nable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on thecontinued growth of demand for th\ne products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditionsworldwide.

For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurityrequirements, we provide c\nertain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. InIndia, the government res\ntricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. Forwww.amazon.in, we provide certain m\narketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we holdindirect minority in\nterests in entities that are third-party sellers on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities complywith existing laws, they involve uniqu\ne risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory,licensing, or other requi\nrements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indianlaws and regulations, and it is poss\nible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses andoperations may be unable to \ncontinue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we orour affiliates have \nin place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws andregulations could result \nin our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced torestructure our opera\ntions or shut down entirely.We Face Risks Related to Successfully Optim\nizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data CentersFailures to adequately \npredict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to timeresult in excess or insuff\nicient fulfillment or data center capacity, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm our business.

Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficientamounts such that we fail to \nmeet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may berequired to take significant\n inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experienceincreases in our net shipping \ncost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for theholiday season. If too many custo\nmers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions thatmake our websites unavailab\nle or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of ourproducts and services. In addi\ntion, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods anddelivery and other fulf\nillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1Arelating to fulfil\nlment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand.We generally have paym\nent terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers.As a result of holiday sales, as o\nf December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (otherthan as a result of cash f\nlows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payableas of December 31. Our accounts pay\nable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cashequivalents, and marketable\n securities balances.Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Allianc\nes, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to RisksWe provide physical, e-c\nommerce, and omnichannel retail and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and businessrelationships. Under these ag\nreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers tooffer products or servic\nes through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resourcecommitments, which may l\nimit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of thesecommercial relationships, w\nhich may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware,content, and third-party so\nftware, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercialagreements is parti\nally dependent on the volume of the other company\u2019s sales. Therefore, when the other company\u2019s offerings are not successful, the compensationwe receive may be lower\n than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercialrelationships and strat\negic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we areunsuccessful in implemen\nting, maintaining, or developing these services.As our agreements termin\nate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter intoamendments on less favorab\nle terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operatingresults.\nOur present and fut\nure e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as:\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\u2022\nimpairment of other relationships;\u2022\nvariability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and\u2022\ndifficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.Our Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments\nWe have acquired and inves\nted in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additionalcompanies. These transac\ntions create risks such as:\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\u2022\nproblems retaining key personnel;\u2022\nadditional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;\u2022\nthe potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;9", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5167, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b51f076-5c80-4622-af46-e64a9138f94b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b51f076-5c80-4622-af46-e64a9138f94b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Amazon2020.pdf", "file_path": "10k-data\\Amazon2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 619184, "creation_date": "2025-02-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2afc83a4-b6b5-4d76-8d40-14893f110b2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Amazon2020.pdf", "file_path": "10k-data\\Amazon2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 619184, "creation_date": "2025-02-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-22"}, "hash": "f33ed5a154dd1b97c640e4a4c1a6dada1a8aeac4da8ec8e57534c2f169a16638", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\u2022\nthe potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result ofany integration of opera\ntions;\u2022\nthe difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;\u2022\nthe difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating a new company\u2019s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and information security, human resource, andother administrative systems\n to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented;\u2022\nlosses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee\u2019s financial performance into ourfinancial results;\n\u2022\nfor investments in which an investee\u2019s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on theinvestee\u2019s accounting, f\ninancial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes;\u2022\nthe difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;\u2022\nthe risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and\u2022\nfor foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, andregulatory risks associate\nd with specific countries.As a result of future acquis\nitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, oramortization expenses \nrelated to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, ifat all. In addition, valu\nations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly. We could determine that such valuations haveexperienced impairments or ot\nher-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.We Have Foreign Exchange Risk\nThe results of operations of, \nand certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposedto foreign exchange rat\ne fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains orlosses on the remeasurem\nent of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations hasincreased. We also hold c\nash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies including British Pounds, Euros, and Japanese Yen. When theU.S. Dollar strengthens compared to \nthese currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expectedand vice versa.\nThe Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain H\nighly Skilled and Other Key Personnel Could Negatively Affect OurBusiness\nWe depend on our senior manage\nment and other key personnel, particularly Jeffrey P. Bezos, our President, CEO, and Chairman. We do not have \u201ckeyperson\u201d life insurance po\nlicies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry has historically beenintense, particular\nly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees or theinability to hire, tr\nain, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches\nBecause we collect, process, s\ntore, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information,failure to prevent or \nmitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors\u2019 or customers\u2019 technology, products,and systems, could expose us or our custo\nmers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation,regulatory action (in\ncluding under privacy or data protection laws), and potential liability for us, deter customers or sellers from using our stores and services, andotherwise harm our business and r\neputation.

Although we havedeveloped systems and processes \nthat are designed to protect customer information and prevent such incidents, including systems and processes designed to reducethe impact of a secur\nity breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or becircumvented.\nWe Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy\nWe experience occas\nional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us fromefficiently acc\nepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services.Steps we take to add software and ha\nrdware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not besufficient to avoid syste\nm interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results.Our computer and communica\ntions systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such asnatural or man-made disasters\n, extreme weather, geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer viruses,physical or electroni\nc break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and couldprevent us from accept\ning and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject usto liability. Our systems a\nre not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficientcoverage to compensate \nfor related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.We Face Significant Inventory Risk\nIn addition to risks describ\ned elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed tosignificant inventory r\nisks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles andpricing, defective m\nerchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage,and other factors. We end\neavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand forproducts, however, can change signi\nficantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling ormanufacturing a new product, \nit may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecastdemand. The acquisition of c\nertain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry abroad selection and signif\nicant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantitiesor to meet demand during th\ne relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results.We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protec\nting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of ThirdParties\nWe regard our trademarks, \nservice marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical toour success, and we rely on trade\nmark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees,customers, and others to prot\nect our proprietary rights.

The outcomes of th\nese matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from suchmatters involves judgmen\nt and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may beexposed to losses in excess of the \namount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to havebeen incorrect, it cou\nld have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that aresolution of one or more such p\nroceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to makesubstantial future paym\nents, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverseto our business, requiring develop\nment of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a materialeffect on our operations.\nWe Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Colle\nction ObligationsWe are subject to a va\nriety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognizeadditional tax expense and b\ne subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations,administrative pra\nctices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accountingrules in various jurisdic\ntions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions areconsidering or have adopted l\naws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and theremote selling of goods and se\nrvices. These include new obligations to collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remotesellers, or other requi\nrements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, the European Union, certain member states, and other countrieshave proposed or enacted tax\nes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected byadditional taxes of this n\nature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collectionobligations or failure \nto provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. Insome cases we also may not have su\nfficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collectionobligations by the effec\ntive date.Our tax expense and liabili\nties are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into newbusinesses and geographies, inte\nrcompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able torealize relat\ned tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, and changes in ourdeferred tax assets and \nliabilities and their valuation. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense and liabilities. In the ordinarycourse of our business, there a\nre many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, the legislation known asthe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cU.S. Tax Act\u201d) requ\nires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law,significant judgments to b\ne made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis ofinformation not previously \nrelevant or regularly produced.

Actual results coulddiffer materia\nlly for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customerspending, world events, the rate o\nf growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new businessopportunities and the tim\ning of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared withservices, the extent to whi\nch we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growthand expansion, the outcomes of c\nlaims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization,risks of inventory managem\nent, seasonality, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completedacquisitions and strateg\nic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the global economic climate amplifiesmany of these risks.

The products offered through our s tores includemerchandise and content we h\nave purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and producemedia content. General\nly, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items soldby third-party sellers \nas service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. Wealso offer other servi\nces such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions.Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainab\nle growth in free cash flows1. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income andefficiently manag\ning working capital2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operatingincome primarily r\nesult from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make inlonger-term strat\negic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focuson improving all aspect\ns of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasingselection, producing origin\nal content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improvingreliability, and ea\nrning customer trust.We seek to reduce our variabl\ne costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include p roduct and content costs, payment processingand related transac\ntion costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and aportion of our marketing cos\nts. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to ouronline stores, web services, e\nlectronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment and delivery networks and related facilities. Variablecosts generally change di\nrectly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, categoryexpansion, and other factors. To d\necrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing,increase discounts from supp\nliers, and reduce defects in our processes.

We believe that advan ces in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the advances of wirelessconnectivity, and the \npractical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet andincrease its ubiquity in p\neople\u2019s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deployinnovative and effici\nent software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and otherservice offerings to dev\nelopers and enterprises of all sizes.We seek to effici\nently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions,and aligning employee compensation with shareho\nlders\u2019 interests. We utilize restr icted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because webelieve this compensat\nion model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested andunvested stock awards outstanding, withou\nt regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 507 million  and 512 million\n as of December 31, 2018  and 2019 . Our financial reporting currency is \nthe U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens y\near-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses willbe higher than if curren\ncies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, ourconsolidated net sales and op\nerating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond theU.S. economy through our growing internation\nal businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operatingresults and growth rates befo\nre and after the effect of currency changes.In addition, the remeasu\nrement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreigncurrency exchange rat\nes. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidatedtrends and comparisons.\nFor additional informat\nion about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 1 \u2014Description of Business and Accounting Poli\ncies.\u201dOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year end\ned December 31, 2018  includes a discussion and analys is of our financial condition and results ofoperations for the year \nended December 31, 2017  in Item 7 of Part II, \u201cMan agement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d_______________________\n(3)\nThe operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days.20", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4923, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "432be488-08dc-4246-9711-30dbfe755db6": {"__data__": {"id_": "432be488-08dc-4246-9711-30dbfe755db6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "Amazon2020.pdf", "file_path": "10k-data\\Amazon2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 619184, "creation_date": "2025-02-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a63bf8bf-0a66-47df-92fe-28372c9c967d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "Amazon2020.pdf", "file_path": "10k-data\\Amazon2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 619184, "creation_date": "2025-02-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-22"}, "hash": "237644991f82014a71a4d27fbed5496556e02ba523e5a0009e0566693950f1d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "95225552-acb2-46f5-845a-c0fd9dce9a82", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "19ef0cec08e212554976c9a8a2ba86f08f81e99a8534ac0a8a8713db25177eaa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Judgments\nThe preparation of finan\ncial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires estimates andassumptions that affec\nt the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidatedfinancial statem\nents and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company\u2019s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal ofthe company\u2019s financia\nl condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result ofthe need to make estimates \nof matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgmentsaddressed below. We also have oth\ner key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understandingour results. For additional in\nformation, see Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 1 \u2014 Description of Business and AccountingPolicies.\u201d Although we believe th\nat our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual resultsmay differ signific\nantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.Inventories\nInventories, consisting of produ\ncts available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost andnet realizable va\nlue. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such asthrough sales to individual cus\ntomers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptionsabout future disposition of inv\nentory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in thefuture. As a measure of sensi\ntivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2019 , we would have recorded an addition al costof sales of approximately \n$230 million . In addition, we enter\n into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecastedcustomer demand. If we redu\nce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.Income Taxes\nWe are subject to inco\nme taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles,and interpretations in v\narious jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, andsignificant judgment is \nrequired in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinarycourse of business for which the ul\ntimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in ourbusiness operations, acquisit\nions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings,including earnings being lower \nthan anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we havehigher statutory rates, \nlosses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes inforeign currency exchang\ne rates, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations,administrative pra\nctices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accountingrules in various jurisdic\ntions. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as theU.S. tax reform legislation \ncommonly known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cU.S. Tax Act\u201d).

Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the grosspurchase price of underly\ning transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales byour sellers have higher pay\nment processing costs as a percent of net sales.The \nincrease in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2019 , compared to the prior ye ar, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increasedproduct and service sales vo\nlume and inventory levels and costs from expanding our fulfillment network, which includes physical stores.We seek to expand our fulfi\nllment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes fromsales of our own products as well as sa\nles by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services.

Infrastructure \ncosts include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessaryto support AWS and other Amazon businesses.

We expectspending in technology and content \nto increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segmentsbased on usage. The \nincrease  in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2019 , compared to the prior ye ar, is primarily due to an increase in spending ontechnology infrastructu\nre and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services andinitiatives to introdu\nce new products and service offerings. We expect technology and content costs to grow at a slower rate in 2020 due to an increase in theestimated useful li\nfe of our servers, which will impact each of our segments.

The primary components of oth er income (expense), net are relatedto equity securities and wa\nrrant valuations and foreign currency.Income Taxes\nOur effective tax ra\nte is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix ofjurisdictions to which they r\nelate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments,audit-related deve\nlopments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses),changes in statutes, regul\nations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework,competition, and other l\naws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized.Additionally, our effect\nive tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our ef\nfective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.We recorded a provision fo\nr income taxes of $1.2 billion  and $2.4 billion  in 2018 and 2019 . Our provision for income taxes in 2019 was higher than in 2018primarily due to an inc\nrease in U.S. pre-tax income, a decline in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the one-time provisional tax benefit of theU.S. Tax Act recognized in 2018.\nTax benefits relating \nto excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. The U.S.Tax Act enhanced and extended a\nccelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. As ofDecember 31, 2019\n, we had approximately $1.7 billion  of federal tax credits pote ntially available to offset future tax liabilities.

CONSOLIDATED \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1 \u2014 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS A\nND ACCOUNTING POLICIESDescription of Business\nWe seek to be Earth\u2019s most \ncustomer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers,developers, enterprises, \nand content creators. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offerprograms that enable se\nllers to sell their products in our stores and fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and appdevelopers, and others to publish \nand sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of globalcompute, storage, databas\ne, and other service offerings. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising tosellers, vendors, publishers, and \nauthors, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.We have organized our oper\nations into three  segments: North America, In ternational, and AWS. See \u201cNote 10 \u2014 Segment Information.\u201dPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain prior period amoun\nts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the addition of restricted cash to cash and cashequivalents on our consolidat\ned statements of cash flows and the reclassification of long-term capital lease obligations that existed at December 31, 2018  from \u201cOther long-term liab\nilities\u201d to \u201cLong-term lease liabilities\u201d within the consolidated balance sheets, as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance. See\u201cAccounting Pronouncements Recent\nly Adopted.\u201dPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financi\nal statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d), consisting of itswholly-owned subsidiaries and those en\ntities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in Indiaand certain entities that su\npport our seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. Thefinancial results of \nWhole Foods Market, Inc. (\u201cWhole Foods Market\u201d) have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition onAugust 28, 2017.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of finan\ncial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets andliabilities, revenu\nes and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates areused for, but not limited to, \nincome taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-basedcompensation forfeitu\nre rates, vendor funding, and inventory valuation. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. For example, in Q4 2019 wecompleted a useful li\nfe study for our servers and are increasing the useful life from three years  to four years for servers in January 2020, which, bas ed on serversthat are included in \u201cProp\nerty and equipment, net\u201d as of December 31, 2019, will have an anticipated impact to our 2020 operating income of $2.3 billion . Earnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share is \ncalculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common sh\nares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a netloss, stock awards are excluded \nfrom our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.42", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3891, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c13fc3b-9f96-467d-8b74-2c666e0bd04d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c13fc3b-9f96-467d-8b74-2c666e0bd04d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "Amazon2020.pdf", "file_path": "10k-data\\Amazon2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 619184, "creation_date": "2025-02-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1873388d-7739-4070-bc3d-3acfacce0d7d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "Amazon2020.pdf", "file_path": "10k-data\\Amazon2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 619184, "creation_date": "2025-02-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-22"}, "hash": "8dce3d2030e2161b4860bd117b2389f0042d573a48f1aee58d7a123e94c78a45", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of ContentsThe following table shows the cal\nculation of diluted shares (in millions): \n Year Ended December 31,  \n2017  2018  2019 Shares used in computation of bas\nic earnings per share480  487  494 Total dilutive effe\nct of outstanding stock awards13  13  10 Shares used in computation of di\nluted earnings per share493  500  504 Revenue\nRevenue is measured based on the \namount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, andrebates. Revenue also exclud\nes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multipleperformance obligations, t\nhe transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determinestand-alone selling pri\nces based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.A description of our principa\nl revenue generating activities is as follows:Retail sales\n - We offer consumer produ cts through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to thecustomer, which generally o\nccurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.Third-party seller services\n - We offer programs th at enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller ofrecord in these transa\nctions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services arerendered, which generally o\nccurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.Subscription services\n - Our subscription sales includ e fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including audiobooks, digitalvideo, digital music, e-books, \nand other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefitsthat represent a singl\ne stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements isrecognized over the subscr\niption period.AWS\n - Our AWS arrangements include g lobal sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-aloneselling prices and is pri\nmarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacitydelivered on-demand. Cert\nain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognizedratably. Sales commissions we p\nay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.Other\n - Other revenue primar ily includes sales of advertising services, which are recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks orimpressions.\nReturn Allowances\nReturn allowances, which reduce \nrevenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience.

We generallyconsider these amounts re\nceived from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and arerecorded as a reduction o\nf the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimumpurchase thresholds. We eva\nluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can bereasonably estimated, we \nrecord a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.Fulfillment\nFulfillment costs prim\narily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments\u2019 fulfillment centers,physical stores, and custome\nr service centers, including costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, andpreparing customer orde\nrs for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain sellertransactions; responding to \ninquiries from customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices.

Infrastructure \ncosts include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessaryto support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Coll\nectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services toour customers. Technology and cont\nent costs are generally expensed as incurred.Marketing\nMarketing costs primar\nily consist of advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including salescommissions related to \nAWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertisingarrangements with cer\ntain of our vendors, and other third parties.Advertising and other promotion\nal costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $6.3 billion , $8.2 billion, and $11.0 billion  in 2017\n, 2018, and 2019 . General and Administrative\nGeneral and administra\ntive expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipmentexpenses, such as depreciat\nion and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees and litigation costs.Stock-Based Compensation\nCompensation cost for all sto\nck awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair valueof restricted stock uni\nts is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense overthe service period, net \nof estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment,and to the extent actual re\nsults or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the periodestimates are revised.

Income Taxes\nIncome tax expense includ\nes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S.Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxat\nion on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings,as well as our capital in ou\nr foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs uponrepatriation of such a\nmounts.Deferred income tax balances\n reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and arestated at enacted tax rates ex\npected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.Deferred tax assets are eval\nuated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We considermany factors when assessing the \nlikelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations offuture earnings, capit\nal gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.We utilize a two-step \napproach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax positionfor recognition by deter\nmining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution ofrelated appeals or l\nitigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized uponultimate settle\nment. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments andwhich may not accurately \nforecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as th\ne price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe measurement date. To i\nncrease the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used tomeasure fair value:\nLevel 1 \u2014 \nValuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.Level 2 \u2014 \nValuations based on observable inpu ts other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilitiesin active markets, quoted\n prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can becorroborated by observable \nmarket data.Level 3 \u2014 \nValuations based on unobservable inpu ts reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by othermarket participan\nts. These valuations require significant judgment.For our cash, cash equivalents, or \nmarketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based onquoted prices in active mar\nkets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactivemarkets or based on quoted ma\nrket prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plusany direct costs from exec\nuting the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from \u201cOther assets\u201d upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements arecapitalized at cost and amortized\n over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term.When we have the o\nption to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonablycertain that we will ex\nercise the option, we consider these options in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variablepayments based on measures th\nat include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.Costs associated with operating \nlease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assetsare amortized within op\nerating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does nottransfer at the end of the\n lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effectiveinterest method over th\ne lease term.We establish assets and\n liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Suchassets are depreciated over t\nhe lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.Financing Obligations\nWe record assets and li\nabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during theconstruction period. If we con\ntinue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease.The building is depreciat\ned over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation.If we do not control the building \nafter the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the leaseas either operating or \nfinance.Goodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for \nimpairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not berecoverable. In test\ning goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value ofa reporting unit is less th\nan its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-stepimpairment test. We test goo\ndwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of thereporting units. If the f\nair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, asecond step is performe\nd to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimatethe fair value of the \nreporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operatingexpenses, based primarily on \nexpected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.We completed the requ\nired annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2019 , and determined that goodwil l is no t impairedas the fair value of our \nreporting units substantially exceeded their book value.

The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to beredeemed is recogniz\ned based on customer usage patterns.Unearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue is record\ned when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period.Unearned revenue primar\nily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2018  was $7.9 billion\n, of which $6.3 billion  was recognized as revenue dur ing the year ended December 31, 2019  and our total unearned rev enue as of December 31, 2019 was \n$10.2 billion.

Additionally, we have perform\nance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that havenot yet been recognized in ou\nr financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $29.8 billion\n as of December 31, 2019 . The weighted average rem aining life of our long-term contracts is 3.3 years . However, the amount and timing of revenuerecognition is largely d\nriven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.Other Long-Term Liabilities\nIncluded in \u201cOther lo\nng-term liabilities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to deferred tax liabilities, financing obligations,asset retirement ob\nligations, tax contingencies, and digital video and music content.Foreign Currency\nWe have internationa\nlly-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, aredenominated in local fun\nctional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the localcurrency. Assets and liabil\nities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translatedat average rates pr\nevailing throughout the period.

We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 for all revenue contracts with our customers using the modified retrospectiveapproach and increased r\netained earnings by approximately $650 million . The adjustment primar ily relates to the unredeemed portion of our gift cards, which arenow recognized over the expec\nted customer usage period rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote.

We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with no materialimpact to our consolidate\nd financial statements.In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the account\ning for leases, primarily requiring the recognition of lease assets and liabilities foroperating leases with te\nrms of more than twelve months on our consolidated balance sheets. Under the new guidance, leases previously described as capital leaseobligations and finance l\nease obligations are now referred to as finance leases and financing obligations, respectively. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2019 byrecording an immate\nrial cumulative adjustment to retained earnings rather than retrospectively adjusting prior periods. Prior period amounts were not adjusted andcontinue to be reported in \naccordance with our historic accounting policies resulting in a balance sheet presentation that is not comparable to the prior period in thefirst year of adoption. The \nadoption of this ASU resulted in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities of approximately $21 billion , which included the reclassification o\nf finance lease obligations to operating leases of $1.2 billion . As of December 31, 2018, amounts rela ted to finance lease obligations andconstruction liabilities totaled \n$9.6 billion , of which $1.5 billion  was derecognized for buildings that we do not control during the construction period and $5.4 billion\n and $1.5 billion  were reclassified to finance  leases and operating leases, respectively.In October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the account\ning for income taxes. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income taxconsequences of an interco\nmpany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs. For intercompany transfers of inventory, the incometax effects will cont\ninue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with an increase of approximately $250 million\n to retained earnings and d eferred tax assets net of valuation allowances.In November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the present\nation of restricted cash within the consolidated statements of cash flows. The newguidance requires that \nrestricted cash be added to cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows.

The new guidance alignsthe accounting for product\nion costs of episodic television with that of movies by requiring production costs to be capitalized. Previously, we only capitalized aportion of the production costs \nrelated to our produced episodic television content.

In August2013, Busk v. Integrity Staffing Solutions, In\nc. and Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, and Vance v.Amazon.com, Inc., Zappos.com Inc., ano\nther affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Kelly Services, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the WesternDistrict of Kentucky. In Septemb\ner 2013, Allison v. Amazon.com, Inc. and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for theWestern District of W\nashington, and Johnson v. Amazon.com, Inc. and an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for theWestern District of Kentu\ncky. In October 2013, Davis v. Amazon.com, Inc., an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in theUnited States District Court fo\nr the Middle District of Tennessee. The plaintiffs variously purport to represent a nationwide class of certain current and formeremployees under the Fair Labo\nr Standards Act and/or state-law-based subclasses for certain current and former employees in states including Arizona, California,Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Kentucky, Wash\nington, and Nevada, and one  complaint asserts nationwide breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. Thecomplaints seek an unspeci\nfied amount of damages, interest, injunctive relief, and attorneys\u2019 fees. We have been named in several other similar cases. In December2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Busk that \ntime spent waiting for and undergoing security screening is not compensable working time under the federal wage andhour statute. In February 2015, the \ncourts in those actions alleging only federal law claims entered stipulated orders dismissing those actions without prejudice. InMarch 2016, the United States Distr\nict Court for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Vance case with prejudice. In April 2016, the plaintiffs appealedthe district court\u2019s \njudgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, the court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019sdecision. In June 2017, the United Stat\nes District Court for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Busk and Saldana cases with prejudice. We dispute anyremaining allegat\nions of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.In March 2015, Zitovault, LLC filed \na complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com, LLC, Amazon Web Services, Inc., and Amazon Web Services,LLC for patent infringemen\nt in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges that Elastic Compute Cloud, Virtual PrivateCloud, Elastic Load Balancing, Auto-Sca\nling, and Elastic Beanstalk infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,484,257, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Maintaining N Numberof Simultaneous Cryptographic Sessions Using \na Distributed Computing Environment.\u201d The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of damages,enhanced damages, attorn\neys\u2019 fees, costs, and interest. In January 2016, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District ofWashington.

The U.S. Tax Act s\nignificantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things,lowering the statutory corpo\nrate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreignsubsidiaries, introducing new t\nax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The U.S. Tax Act also enhanced and extended accelerateddepreciation deductions by \nallowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. We reasonably estimated the effects of the U.S. TaxAct and recorded provisional \namounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the U.S. TaxAct of approximately \n$789 million . This amount wa s primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanentreduction in the U.S. statutory co\nrporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of ourforeign subsidiaries. The a\nmount of this one-time tax was not material. In 2018, we completed our determination of the accounting implications of the U.S. TaxAct.\n63", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3396, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d313ca48-ad66-4627-8881-09afa9b7689b": {"__data__": {"id_": "d313ca48-ad66-4627-8881-09afa9b7689b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "Amazon2020.pdf", "file_path": "10k-data\\Amazon2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 619184, "creation_date": "2025-02-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b1dd53dd-cf64-4bc5-9c2a-71d19a5ef5f8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "Amazon2020.pdf", "file_path": "10k-data\\Amazon2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 619184, "creation_date": "2025-02-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-22"}, "hash": "ed42dd77016044918155d17e0752bfa8c98c9db9f2a5520e8517337223af7cc4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of ContentsThe components of the provision fo\nr income taxes, net are as follows (in millions): \nYear Ended December 31,  \n2017  2018  2019 U.S. Federal:\n     Current\n$ (137 ) $(129 ) $162 Deferred\n(202 ) 565  914 Total\n(339 ) 436  1,076 U.S. State:\n     Current\n211  322  276 Deferred\n(26 ) 5  8 Total\n185  327  284 International:\n     Current\n724  563  1,140 Deferred\n199  (129 ) (126 )Total\n923  434  1,014 Provision for income taxes, net\n$ 769  $1,197  $2,374 U.S. and international components o\nf income before income taxes are as follows (in millions): \nYear Ended December 31,  \n2017  2018  2019 U.S.\n$ 5,630  $11,157  $13,285 International\n(1,824 )  104  691 Income before income taxes\n$ 3,806  $11,261  $13,976 The items accounting for\n differences between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision recorded for income taxes are as follows(in millions):\n \nYear Ended December 31,  \n2017  2018  2019 Income taxes computed at t\nhe federal statutory rate (1)$ 1,332  $2,365  $2,935 Effect of:\n     Tax impact of foreign e\narnings1,178  119  381 State taxes, net of fede\nral benefits114  263  221 Tax credits\n(220 ) (419 ) (466 )Stock-based compensation (2)\n(917 ) (1,086 )  (850 )2017 Impact of U.S. Tax Act\n(789 ) (157 ) \u2014 Other, net\n71  112  153 Total\n$ 769  $1,197  $2,374 ___________________\n(1)\nThe U.S. Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018.(2)\nIncludes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that d\neterminations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision theEuropean Commission announced an est\nimated recovery amount of approximately \u20ac250 million , plus interest, for the pe riod May 2006 through June 2014, andordered Luxembourg tax author\nities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount,consistent with the European Comm\nission\u2019s decision, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. InDecember 2017, Luxembourg appeal\ned the European Commission\u2019s decision. In May 2018, we appealed.

Our responsibility is toexpress an opinion on the Company\u2019s int\nernal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB andare required to be indep\nendent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commiss\nion and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in a\nccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet\nher effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an und\nerstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing andevaluating the design and ope\nrating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessaryin the circumstances. \nWe believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over F\ninancial ReportingA company\u2019s internal c\nontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reportingand the preparation of f\ninancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control overfinancial reporting includes\n those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o\nf the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance\n with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori\nzations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us\ne, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l\nimitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu\nre periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur\nes may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nJanuary 30, 2020\n72", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4143, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63f11190-1f2b-441d-979c-c71ead34a8a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "63f11190-1f2b-441d-979c-c71ead34a8a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "Amazon2020.pdf", "file_path": "10k-data\\Amazon2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 619184, "creation_date": "2025-02-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7af47c4c-ab6a-49a2-9236-d24218fe566b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "Amazon2020.pdf", "file_path": "10k-data\\Amazon2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 619184, "creation_date": "2025-02-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-22"}, "hash": "eb9347f974935a19c058572a0d7a30e6974066bec7dc1e57661341e197426962", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of ContentsItem 9B.\nOther Information Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of \nthe Exchange ActWe determined that, b\netween January 2012 and December  2019, we processed and delivered ord ers of consumer products for certain individuals and entitieslocated outside Iran cov\nered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act (\u201cITRA\u201d), in addition to those we have previously disclosed, as follows:consumer products valued at \napproximately $13,700 for individuals who may have been acting for 14 Iranian embassies and diplomatic organizations located incountries other than Ir\nan; consumer products valued at approximately $90 for an individual designated under Executive Order 13224; consumer products valued atapproximately $8,600 for indiv\niduals who may have been acting for seven entities owned or controlled by the Iranian government; and consumer products valuedat approximately $1,800 for \nindividuals who may have been acting for five entities designated under Executive Order 13224 or Executive Order 13382, three ofwhich are owned or controlled by th\ne Iranian Government.
